The Traces.csv file is generated by the three original traces files located at the OriginalTraces folder. 

We merged all the data and ordered by the time information. Thus, we have the original traces in the same sequence generated by the system of components. In this case, the system consists of three components (DOOR, OBSTACLE DETECTOR and TRACTION) and therefore three original traces files.
